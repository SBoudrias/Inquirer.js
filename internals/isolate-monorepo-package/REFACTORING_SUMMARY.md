# Refactoring Summary: Async/Await Performance Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Error Handling

- **Removed catch/rethrow pattern** in `createIsolatedEnvironment`: The try-catch block that was just catching errors to wrap them in `IsolatedBuildError` was removed. Errors now propagate naturally.
- **Simplified error handling** in `bin.ts`: Moved error handling to the top-level catch block where the main function is called.

### 2. Converted to Async/Await for Performance

#### Core Functions Made Async:

- `findWorkspaceRoot()` - Now uses `fsPromises.access()` instead of `fs.existsSync()`
- `discoverWorkspaces()` - Uses `execAsync()` and parallel `Promise.all()` for reading package.json files
- `packWorkspace()` - Converted from `spawnSync` to async `spawn` with Promise wrapper
- `packAllDependencies()` - **Major improvement**: Now packs all dependencies in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- `setupIsolatedEnvironment()` - Uses async file operations (`fsPromises.cp`, `fsPromises.copyFile`, etc.)
- `createIsolatedEnvironment()` - Main orchestrator is now async

#### File Operations:

- Replaced all `fs.*Sync` methods with `fsPromises.*` equivalents
- Removed the `fs` import entirely, now only using `fsPromises`
- All file reads/writes are now non-blocking

#### Process Execution:

- Replaced `execSync` with `execAsync` (promisified version of `exec`)
- Replaced `spawnSync` with async `spawn` wrapped in Promises

### 3. Performance Benefits

The refactoring provides several performance improvements:

1. **Parallel Dependency Packing**: The biggest win - all workspace dependencies are now packed in parallel instead of sequentially
2. **Non-blocking I/O**: File operations no longer block the event loop
3. **Better CPU Utilization**: Multiple operations can progress simultaneously
4. **Maintained Output Order**: Despite async operations, verbose logging still makes sense due to careful ordering

### 4. Testing Results

The refactored tool has been tested and confirmed to work correctly:

- Verbose mode still provides clear, understandable output
- The tool correctly creates isolated environments
- Yarn install works in the isolated environments
- CI compatibility is maintained

## Code Quality Improvements

- Cleaner error handling - errors bubble up naturally
- More idiomatic Node.js async patterns
- Better resource utilization
- Maintained backward compatibility - the CLI interface remains unchanged
